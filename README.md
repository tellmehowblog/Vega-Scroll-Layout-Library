# Idea about Vega Scroll Layout

In this project we use RecyclerView at top of the itemView, with the fingers slide to achieve shrink hiding and magnification display, and with the recycler recycling and reuse.

The code is relatively simple and rude, using custom LayoutManger, built-in SnapHelper.
Since you want to snap to the first sub-view at any time, you can use the method in the LayoutManager to set the maximum value of the scroll.

# Some other LayoutManager we already discuss:
